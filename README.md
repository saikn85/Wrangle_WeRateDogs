## Data Wrangling - WeRateDogs&trade; Twitter Archive

***Introduction***

This project demonstrates the techniques learned for the Data Wrangling process. This is a very part of every data analyst/scientist, no data makes it to the final step unless it has been wrangled properly.

***Project Details***

**Wrangling - The Three Step Process:**
    
1. ***Gathering*** the data,
2. ***Assess*** the gather data for **structural (tidiness)** and **content (quality)** issues,
3. Convert the assessment into defined set of task that will ***clean*** the data, so that it can be later used for EDA or building statistical models.

We will be using the ***twitter archieved dataset of WeRateDogs&trade;*** for this project.

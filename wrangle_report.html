                    This project talks about Data Wrangling that involves three distinct
                    steps that can be revisited anytime; i.e. it is iterative if your
                    needs are not met. The three steps are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gathering</li>
                        <li>Assessing</li>
                        <li>Cleaning</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                    Personally this project was the longest that I had ever worked on, it
                    took me about 10 days to finish this. The delay was because of the
                    application for security tokens for Twitter API.

            <p>The following were the issues that I had to over come.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Gathering</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Querying the API was bit troublesome as on an average it took about 30
                            minutes to fetch data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Querying the API for missing records: I thought that there was
                            something wrong with my code, so I redid the entire thing, only to find out that the records had been deleted and 
                            there was nothing wrong with the code.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4 class="text-center">Assessing</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This was easy, it took about an hour or so find faults and criticise
                            it for all the mess it was in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although, assessing the image-predictions.tsv file was a bit
                            overwhelming as there was nothing wrong in it, until programmatic assessment
                            was done.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4 class="text-center">Cleaning</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Well, this was the longest of all the processes. Defining the
                            cleaning goals initially was tough, but it all got easy after two
                            attempts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another challenge that I had to encounter was defining the regular
                            expressions for extracting name from text, and to find those, that 
                            were missed by regexs'.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                Well, this one will teach you to learn the importance of cleaning, gathering and assessing data
                before we start building model or performing EDA.

                It is strongly recommended that every individual must take a refresher
                course in python and pandas, after all you get used to R's syntax and
                it ability to handle untidy data.

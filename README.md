***Introduction***

This project demonstrates the techniques learned for the Data Wrangling process. This is a very part of every data analyst/scientist, no data makes it to the final step unless it has been wrangled properly.

***Project Details***

1. ***Gathering*** the data,
2. ***Assess*** the gather data for structural (tidiness) and content (quality) issues,
3. Convert the assessment into defined set of task that will ***clean*** the data, so that it can be later used for EDA or building statistical models.

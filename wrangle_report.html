                    This project talks about Data Wrangling that involves three distinct
                    steps that can be revisited anytime; i.e. it is iterative if your
                    needs are not met. The three steps are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gathering</li>
                        <li>Assessing</li>
                        <li>Cleaning</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>

                    Personally this project was the longest that I had ever worked on, it
                    took me like 10 days to finish this, the delays was because of the
                    application for accessing Twitter.

            <p>The following were the issues that I had to over come.</p>
            <div class="card-deck">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Gathering</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Querying the API was bit trouble some as on an average it took 30
                            mins to fetch data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Querying the API for missing records. I thought that there was
                            something wrong with my code, so I redid the entire thing, but later
                            I found that there was nothing wrong with the code.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Assessing</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This was easy, it took about an hour or so find falts and criticise
                            it for all the mess it was in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although, assessing the image-predictions.tvs file was a bit
                            overwhelming as there was nothing wrong in it, until programmatic
                            was done.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Cleaning</h4><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Well, this was the longest of all processes. Properly defining the
                            cleaning goals initial was tough, but it all got easy after two
                            attempts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another challenge that I had to encounter was defining the regular
                            expressions for extracting name from text, and to find those that 
                            were missed by regexs'.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                Well, this one will teach you to learn the importance of cleaning data
                before we start building model or performing EDA. Not only cleaning, as
                well in gathering and assessing.

                It is strongly recommended that every individual must take a refresher
                course in python and pandas, after all you get used with R's syntax and
                it ability to handle undity data with the help from 'tidyverse' package.
